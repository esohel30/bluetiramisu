Team SMH
Roster: Eric Sohel and Wilson Mach
DISCO:
    1. file methods:
        A. file.open() opens file
        B. file.close() closes file
        C. file.read() reads file
    2. string.split() splits strings by specified character
    3. list.pop() removes values from list
    4. string.maketrans() and string.translate() can be used to replace characters in string
    5. break breaks out of loop
    
QCC:
    1. how to find last element in a dictionary? We were trying to figure this out but couldn't
    find a good solution so we just accessed last element of the spliced_data list instead
    
HOW THIS SCRIPT WORKS:
    1. make dictionary
        A. open, read, close data file
        B. splice by line into list
        C. delete first + last line due to useless data
        D. splice by last comma in line
        E. iterate through spliced data, removes the the instances of '"' in job
        F. put job and percentage into dictionary
    2. randomly pick job with weighted percentage
        A. picks a random number between 0 and 999, inclusive of 0 and not 999 with a step of 1
        B. iterates through dictionary, adding up all percentages until it reaches a number greater than
        random number
        C. breaks out of loop and prints out job associated with percentage
        D. If no job has been printed after iteration, print last job
