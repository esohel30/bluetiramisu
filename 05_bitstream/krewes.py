"""
Eric Sohel and Wilson Mach
Time take: 2 hours
OPS: 
1. takes in file "krewes.txt" and reads it
2. iterate through the string
3. keep a counter of current characters, e, and adjust another counter of current category data, counter
4. If character is "$", skips 3 characters and update counter
5. If character is "@", inputs the strings in each category in the dictionary. 
6. After dictionary is formed from steps above, randomly choose a devo and returns the period and ducky in a string
7. Splits the string by the ":" to get period and ducky.
8. Prints out devo, period, and ducky.
DISCO: 
1. How to read a file and convert it into a string
2. how to use split() to separate strings by a specified character
QCC: 
1. There was probably a way to use split to more efficient produce a program than we did.
